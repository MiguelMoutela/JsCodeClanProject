# JavaScript Project Specs

## Events Dashboard
Individuals want to be able to find relevant cultural events on a dashboard with an event type of their choice.
The project should use an existing API or an API of your own creation.
The app should display information about fixtures, news and travel information for events.

## Possible APIs to use:
The list
Eventful
Google Maps
Geo-Location

### MVP
Display upcoming events on a map, and relevant details within a table.
Allow users to add events to a 'favourites list' database.
Perform CRUD operation on database items.

### Possible Extensions
Route Planner.
Integrate weather information from Weather API.
Police data including crimes committed for surrounding area.

##AIMS/PURPOSE:
To gain experience working in a team with other developers - to understand some of the challenges this creates and ways to overcome these.

To have the opportunity to try using agile practices.

To become more confident using Git/GitHub for a multi person project.

To consolidate learning from the JavaScript module and have the opportunity to try some new things - the project is not focused on making an exciting end product, more on the process and teamwork.

To create a project using core Javascript - this means NO frameworks or jQuery are allowed. Only use the tools/packages we have used in class, and if you have any questions about additional tools ask an instructor.

One person should create a project, then add the rest of the team as collaborators.
