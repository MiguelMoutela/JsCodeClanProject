JavaScript Group Project Guidelines
AIMS/PURPOSE:

To gain experience working in a team with other developers - to understand some of the challenges this creates and ways to overcome these

To have the opportunity to try using agile practices

To become more confident using Git/GitHub for a multi person project

To consolidate learning from the JavaScript module and have the opportunity to try some new things - the project is not focused on making an exciting end product, more on the process and teamwork.

To create a project using core Javascript - this means NO frameworks or jQuery are allowed. Only use the tools/packages we have used in class, and if you have any questions about additional tools ask an instructor.

One person should create a project, then add the rest of the team as collaborators.
